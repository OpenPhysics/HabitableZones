# Model - Habitable Zones

This document describes the model (the underlying physics, math, and behavior) for the simulation,
in terms appropriate for an educator. It is the companion to
[implementation-notes.md](./implementation-notes.md), which targets developers.

## Overview

This sim ports the NAAP *Habitable Zones* lab and has two screens that ask where liquid-water
conditions can persist — around a single star, and across the Milky Way.

- **Circumstellar** follows a star through its evolutionary track. As luminosity changes, the
  circumstellar habitable zone (HZ) moves. Students place a planet at a chosen distance, scrub or play
  the stellar timeline, switch between optimistic and conservative HZ limits, overlay solar-system
  reference orbits, and load six real exoplanet systems. A **destruction marker** on the timeline
  shows when the planet would be engulfed as the star expands; **tidal-locking time** appears in the
  status readout (not as a timeline marker).
- **Galactic** lets students pick a galactocentric radius and read off normalized metallicity,
  catastrophic-event risk, and a combined habitability score. The galactic habitable zone (GHZ) is the
  annular band where metallicity is high enough and risk low enough. Those radial curves are a
  **parametric reconstruction** of the NAAP pedagogy, not a byte-for-byte port of unpublished Flash
  formulae.

Together the screens connect "is this orbit temperate?" with "is this neighborhood of the Galaxy
favorable for rocky planets and long-term stability?"

## Governing equations

### Circumstellar habitable zone

At each age the star's luminosity *L* (in solar units) sets the HZ edges:

```
d_in  = √(L / L☉) · c_in
d_out = √(L / L☉) · c_out
```

Optimistic limits use `c_in = 0.8`, `c_out = 1.5` (AU for a solar twin). Conservative limits use
`0.95` and `1.37`. The planet is classified too hot / temperate / too cold by comparing its
**effective** distance *d_eff* to those edges.

### Orbital distance while the star evolves

As the star loses mass, specific angular momentum conservation in the NAAP model stretches the orbit:

```
d_eff(t) = d₀ · (M₀ / M(t))
```

**Destruction** occurs when *d_eff* falls inside a Roche-like limit from the star's instantaneous
radius and density (with a minimum helper of 1.5 AU).

**Tidal-locking time** uses an Earth-like spin-down formula that depends strongly on distance (∝ d⁶)
and stellar mass, evaluated at the **zero-age distance d₀** — it does **not** update as the orbit
stretches with mass loss.

### Stellar tracks

Seventeen tabulated stars (0.3–30 M☉) store mass, log luminosity, log radius, and log temperature
versus age. Values at intermediate ages are linearly interpolated from a compressed track (every 3rd
point + endpoints). Epoch markers follow Hurley–Pols–Tout stellar-type codes for main-sequence end and
final remnant. Zero-age main-sequence Sun in the catalog is dimmer/cooler than present-day Sun.

### Timeline displays

The circumstellar timeline shows:

- An **equilibrium-temperature curve** (0–100 °C clamp) computed using **d₀** (not *d_eff*).
- A **habitability color strip** using **d_eff** vs HZ edges — students may see temperature and HZ band
  diverge in meaning as the star evolves.
- Epoch labels and a scrubbable age cursor; play/pause/step advance age.

### Real exoplanet presets

Six systems: Gliese 581, 55 Cancri A, 51 Pegasi, HD 40307, HD 189733, HD 93083. Selecting a preset
locks star mass to the nearest catalog entry, places the primary draggable planet at the **first**
planet's **pericenter** *a(1−e)*, and draws all preset planets as diagram overlays.

### Galactic habitability (reconstructed)

Relative to the Sun's radius (~8 kpc), metallicity follows a radial [Fe/H] gradient
(~−0.07 dex/kpc), then is normalized across the plotted range. Catastrophic risk falls off
exponentially with radius (e-folding scale 3.5 kpc from inner edge). Combined habitability is:

```
H(R) = Z(R) · (1 − Risk(R))
```

The GHZ is the contiguous annulus where normalized metallicity ≥ **0.35** and risk ≤ **0.45** — about
**4.0–7.3 kpc** in this reconstruction. The default Sun location at **8 kpc** is **outside** this GHZ
(Z ≈ 0.31, risk ≈ 0.14). Habitability is shown as a numeric readout; plots show metallicity and risk
only.

## Initial conditions (Circumstellar reset)

Sun (1 M☉), age 0, planet at 1 AU, optimistic HZ, reference orbits on, grid off.

## Simplifications and assumptions

- Circumstellar HZ uses **insolation-only** scaling with luminosity; no climate, atmosphere, or
  greenhouse modeling beyond the optimistic/conservative coefficient pairs.
- Planet is a test particle: no feedback on the star; tidal lock and destruction are diagnostic
  markers, not full dynamical integrations.
- Reference solar-system orbits are **circular** fixed semi-major axes (Mercury through Neptune; eight
  orbits).
- Tidal-lock timeline marker is suppressed if it would be narrower than 4 px on the 900 px timeline.
- Galactic curves are **pedagogical reconstructions**, not the original Flash plot data or a full
  chemical-evolution model.
